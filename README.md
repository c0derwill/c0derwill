- 👋 Hi, I’m @c0derwill
- 👀 I’m interested in ... getting these skills under my belt
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... from scratch
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... my own level until I can write code that works
- 📫 How to reach me ... with arms, preferably! Or a long stick if I'm out of range. Just throw it in my vicinity I should hear the crack on the ground nearby.
